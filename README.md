📚 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains a structured collection of Data Structures and Algorithms problems implemented in Python.

 DSA Problems Overview
 Project | Description (Problems included) | Definition |
|---------|-------------------------------|------------|
| Arrays & Strings | Two Sum, Maximum Subarray, Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters, Product of Array Except Self | **Array:** A collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations. **String:** Sequence of characters representing text. |
| Hashing | Group Anagrams, Top K Frequent Elements, Subarray Sum Equals K | **Hashing:** Technique to map data to a fixed-size value (hash) for efficient lookup and storage. |
| Two Pointers / Sliding Window | Valid Palindrome, Container With Most Water, Minimum Window Substring | **Two Pointers / Sliding Window:** Technique to solve problems using two moving pointers for optimal traversal. |
| Linked List | Reverse Linked List, Merge Two Sorted Lists, Detect Cycle in Linked List | **Linked List:** A linear collection of nodes where each node points to the next node. |
| Stack & Queue | Valid Parentheses, Min Stack, Daily Temperatures | **Stack:** LIFO data structure (Last In First Out). **Queue:** FIFO data structure (First In First Out). |
| Trees | Maximum Depth of Binary Tree, Diameter of Binary Tree, Lowest Common Ancestor, Validate Binary Search Tree | **Tree:** Hierarchical data structure with nodes connected in parent-child relationships. |
| Graphs | Number of Islands, Course Schedule, BFS & DFS Traversals | **Graph:** Collection of nodes (vertices) and edges representing relationships or connections. |
| Dynamic Programming | Climbing Stairs, House Robber, Coin Change, Longest Increasing Subsequence | **Dynamic Programming:** Optimization technique solving problems by storing results of subproblems to avoid recomputation. |
